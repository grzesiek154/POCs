-gradlew is a wrapper that uses gradle.
Under the hood the Gradle Wrapper performs three things:

    1 Parse the arguments passed to gradlew
    2 Install the correct Gradle version
    3 Invoke Gradle to run the specified tasks

Using Gradle Wrapper you don’t need to manage project Gradle distributions themselves. It means that each developer in your project uses the same version of Gradle and can run Gradle build(even if Gradle was not installed)
